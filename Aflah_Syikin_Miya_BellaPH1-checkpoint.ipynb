    "The transportation sector is one of the main players contributing to global greenhouse gas emissions, with internal combustion engine vehicles being the major emitters of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent pollutant. Since cars are the most widely used and fossil fuel-dependent means of transport, passengers and automobile travel are charged with the highest quantity of CO2 emission. Pressure is building on governments and other stakeholders to promote sustainability in mobility and reduce vehicular emissions as concerns on climate change and environmental degradation grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing annual registration of cars has been witnessed since the past decade in Malaysia, reflecting economic expansion, development with improvement in living standards. This in itself poses a major problem of nature. From a few hundred thousand to as many hundreds of thousands, if only some certain number of numbers were put on the road in Malaysia every year, the understanding of their emission profiles becomes very much possible. These emissions will allow one to examine the environmental impact given by the newly registered cars and determine actual trends dictate kind of manufacturers, fuel types, and geographical locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with real-world datasets and conducting an investigation on the relationship between automobile features and CO2 emission shows that the interaction between automobiles, emission, and the factors affecting the emission from CO2, includes engine fuel, fuel category, and model. To do this, fuel consumption and emission data of 2014 are integrated with car registration data of Malaysia for the year 2025."
